Introduction

I begin with a brief introduction about this project and the different stages of the design and the development of LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. Before detailed discussion, first of all I would like to give an overall idea about this project.

TITLE OF THE PROJECT 

“LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”

I developed my project on LIBRARY MANGEMNET SYSTEM, because library System is one of the most common and the application implemented in any higher educational organization. Library is place where  

	In University a large amount of data is processed and the results are used in running an organization. The Library management system project maintains the list of students and faculties which get their books issued from the library and calculates and sees if there is a fine due or not.

For this the concept of linked lists is a better option and it will be used to keep track of the books being issued from the library and to calculate the fine over it.
