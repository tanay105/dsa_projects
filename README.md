Undergraduate DSA projects

Project 1: 
Library Management System using Linked Lists.

Used a hybrid Linked List structure to create a Library Management System. Some of the features are:
1. Add/Modify/Delete User to the data structure.
2. Add/Modify/Delete books from the user data structure.
3. Calculate fine if books are overdue.

Project 2:
Time complexity comparison of AVL trees vs Redblack trees.

This project computes the time complexity over 1 Million operations in both AVL trees and Redblack trees. Then using the results we can compare and find which one is better to use. Some of the features are:
1. Time to insert 1 Million nodes in both AVL and Redblack trees.
1. Time to delete 1 Million nodes in both AVL and Redblack trees.
1. Time to modify 1 Million nodes in both AVL and Redblack trees.
